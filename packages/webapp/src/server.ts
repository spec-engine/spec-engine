// IMPORTANT: do NOT switch to Bun.file("./index.html.txt") — that resolves at
// runtime and fails inside the `bun build --compile` binary.
// IMPORTANT: this package may NOT import bun:sqlite, node:fs, fs, bun,
// node:path, or anything from @spec-engine/spec-engine (enforced by D-09 lint).

 * Mount the SSR pages onto an existing Hono app and return

 * `mountApi(app, storage)`'s "mutate-one-app" composition (RESEARCH Open
 * Q1) so `commands/serve.ts` can compose engine + webapp on
 * one Hono instance:
 *
 *   const app = new Hono();
 *   mountApi(app, storage);   // /api/*  (engine)
 *   mountWebapp(app);         // /, /requirements, /propagation/:id, /query, /relations, /provenance  (webapp)
 *
 * Each page handler closes over `app` so it can read its own `/api/*`
 * routes in-process via `app.request(path)` (never
 * `fetch("http://...")`).
 *
 * NOTE: `mountWebapp` registers `/` — do NOT call it on the app returned
 * by `createApp()` (the probe factory) because that one already
 * has `/` bound to the placeholder. The real-serve composer
 * builds a fresh `new Hono()` and calls both mount functions on it.
